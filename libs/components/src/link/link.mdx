# Link / Text button

Text Links and Buttons use the `primary-500` color and can use either the `<a>` or `<button>` tags.
Choose which based on the action the button takes:

- if navigating to a new page, use a `<a>`
- if taking an action on the current page use a `<button>`

Text buttons or links are most commonly used in paragraphs of text or in forms to customize actions
or show/hide additional form options.

<Primary />
<Controls />

## Sizes

There are 2 sizes for the component: default and small.

Default uses `text-base` and small uses `text-xs`

Text Links/buttons can have icons on left or the right.

To indicate a new or add action, the <i class="bwi bwi-plus-circle"></i> icon on is used on the
