# Menu

Menus are used to help organize related options. Menus are most often used for item options in
tables.

<Story of={stories.ClosedMenu} />
<Controls />

## Accessibility

Follow WCAG AA best practices. Example: Insure the triggering element has `aria-haspopup="true"`
prior to being clicked and `aria-expanded="true"` after the user clicks the element.

User should be able to navigate the opened menu via the up and down arrow keys and close the menu
using the escape key or clicking out of the menu.
